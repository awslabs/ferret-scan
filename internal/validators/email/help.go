		ShortDescription: "Detects email addresses and identifies specific email providers",
		DetailedDescription: `The Email check detects email addresses using pattern matching and contextual analysis, with automatic identification of specific email providers.

It validates email addresses against RFC standards and performs additional checks to reduce false positives from test data and placeholder emails. The validator analyzes the username, domain, and TLD components separately for comprehensive validation.

The validator automatically identifies specific email providers and displays them in the TYPE column for better categorization:
