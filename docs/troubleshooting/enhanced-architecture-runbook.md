## Quick Health Check

### Symptoms
- System appears unresponsive
- Unexpected errors during processing
- Performance issues

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Overall System Health**
   ```bash
   # Basic functionality test
   ferret-scan --version
   
   # Test with a simple file
   echo "test content" > test.txt
   ferret-scan test.txt
   ```

2. **Check Health Endpoints** (if web interface is running)
   ```bash
   curl -f http://localhost:8080/health
   ```

3. **Check Process Status**
   ```bash
   # Check if ferret-scan processes are running
   ps aux | grep ferret-scan
   
   # Check system resources
   top -p $(pgrep ferret-scan)
   ```

### Resolution Steps

1. **If basic functionality fails:**
   - Verify ferret-scan binary is accessible
   - Check file permissions
   - Verify dependencies are installed

2. **If health check fails:**
   - Check logs for error messages
   - Verify configuration files
   - Restart the service if necessary

## Content Routing Issues

### Symptoms
- Files not being processed correctly
- Content separation failures
- Unexpected routing decisions

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Enable Debug Logging**
   ```bash
   ferret-scan --debug --file your-file.pdf
   ```

2. **Check Routing Decision Logs**
   Look for log entries with `component: "debug_logger"` and `operation: "routing_decision"`

3. **Verify Preprocessor Detection**
   ```bash
   # Check if preprocessors are working
   ferret-scan --list-preprocessors
   ```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Content Not Being Separated
**Symptoms:** All content goes to document path, no metadata extraction

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check preprocessor output
ferret-scan --debug --preprocessor-only your-file.pdf
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify file format is supported
2. Check if metadata preprocessors are enabled
3. Ensure file is not corrupted
4. Check file permissions

#### Issue: Incorrect Routing Decisions
**Symptoms:** Content routed to wrong validation path

**Diagnosis:**
- Check routing decision logs for reasoning
- Verify preprocessor type identification

   ```

2. **Verify Both Paths Are Active**
   ```bash
   # Check for both document and metadata path activity
   grep -E "(document|metadata)_path" ferret-scan.log
   ```

3. **Test Each Path Individually**
   ```bash
   # Force document path only
   ferret-scan --document-path-only your-file.txt
   
   # Force metadata path only  
   ferret-scan --metadata-path-only your-file.pdf
   ```
